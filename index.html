              <p>Aside from talking about myself throughout this entire website, I wanted to dedicate a page towards resources that I or others close to me have found extremely helpful. This is not professional advice, but instead a list of resources that were beneficial for myself and may be beneficial for others. 
                <br><br>Although this is not professional advice, I strive for accuracy. If any information is inaccurate or outdated please do not hesitate to contact me through email or social media (listed at the bottom of page). <i>Updated 1/24/2025.</i>
              </p>
                <h2>Food Assistance</h2>
            <p>I have personally faced food insecurity as a college student, and I understand that eating well while being a full-time student can be difficult. I feel like there can be some stigma around receiving food stamps, and at first I felt undeserving and also embarrassed about receiving government financial help. It takes time to adjust, but by sharing my experiences, I was able to encourage many of my friends to apply for SNAP. Resulting in those that were eligible being able to reduce their financial stress and no longer prioritize cost over health.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href='https://gettingsnap.org/how-to-apply' target='_blank'>Project Bread</a> was a huge resource for me, it helped me determine if I was eligible and kept me compliant with regulations and expectations associated with receiving governmental assistance. They also have a chatbot who can answer your questions.</li> 
              </ul>
              <h3>Healthy Incentives Program:</h3>
              <p>I swear, this does not get talked about enough! I used to work at a farm stand and the majority of my time I was talking about the benefits of this. This is for those who are eligible for EBT/food stamps. The amount ranges, but when purchasing local fruits and vegetables from eligible vendors, HIP will automatically put SNAP dollars back onto your card. (More information <a href='https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-healthy-incentives-program-hip-frequently-asked-questions' target='_blank'>here</a>)
              <br><br>How it works:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Ensure you have enough SNAP dollars on your account:</b> This program does not work if your balance is empty, so make sure that you have at least the same amount of money on your card that you plan to use for HIP. Also note that the HIP restart date is not the same date as your monthly benefits. For example, if I wanted to use all 20 of my HIP allowance, I need to make sure that I have 20 SNAP dollars on my card.</li>
                <li><b>Find a <a href='https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-healthy-incentives-program-hip-frequently-asked-questions' target='_blank'>HIP eligible vendor:</a></b> This is often the harder part, as some places are seasonal or only run on certain days. If you live in the Boston area, there is a farmers market that runs weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays from May to November at Copley Square, 11AM-6PM. This market is accessible by both the Green Line (Copley) and Orange Line (Back Bay). You can also use <a href='https://dtafinder.dtadash.ehs.mass.gov/' target='_blank'>this link</a> to find more HIP retailers in Massachusetts. For those that are unable to travel to a HIP eligible location or want to use HIP benefits during the winter seasons, there are also vendors that offer delivery and off-season items. I have not personally used this service but I know that Boston Public Market Farmers’ Market vendors can deliver CSA boxes. I’ve heard good things about <a href='https://sienafarms.com/collections' target='_blank'>Siena Farms</a> and <a href='https://stillmansfarm.com/hip/' target='_blank'>Stillman’s</a>. Possibly also <a href='https://www.roundtableservants.com/' target='_blank'>Round Table Servants</a>?</li>
                <li><b>Select HIP eligible items:</b>This is often a point of confusion. HIP eligible vendors may also sell non-HIP items, such as honey, meat, or eggs. Note that seeds and seedlings are eligible items! (Find community gardens <a href='https://www.communitygarden.org/garden' target='_blank'>here</a>) Before you check out, make sure to confirm with the vendor that your items are eligible.</li>
                <li><b>Confirm purchase and return of expected funds:</b>We cashiers are bound to make mistakes. Make sure to ask for a receipt and confirm that the cashier used your HIP balance. We have to click a specific section for this, so double-check the amount. The bottom of your receipt will also tell you your remaining HIP balance (which the app will not) so if you have a remaining balance make note of that balance for next time. It's also important to note that HIP funds cannot be refunded.</li></ul>
              <h2>Women's and AFAB Health</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>In Boston, there are free menstrual products located in City Hall on the 2nd floor near the City of Boston Credit Union and the 8th floor near south elevators, which dispenses free pads and tampons.</li>
                <li>Regardless of what others say, we all have the right to chose, whatever that choice may be. To ensure that you are being provided with all possible options in your care journey, please check out the resources on the <a href='https://www.mass.gov/avoid-anti-abortion-centers ' target='_blank'>Massachusetts’ government website</a> for more information. </li>  
                <li><a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center?location= ' target='_blank'>Planned Parenthood</a> is not just an abortion clinic, they also provide behavioral health services, gender affirming hormone therapy, primary care, STI testing and more. Please check out Planned Parenthood's variety of resources <a href='https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center?location= ' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>        
              </ul>
              <h2>Community Initiatives</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Government assistance program directory:</b> <a href='https://www.211.org/' target='_blank'>211</a> provides a variety of governmental assistance programs that you can filter by state.</li>
                <li><b>General mutual aid:</b> to see if food resources and support networks are near you, click <a href='https://www.mutualaidhub.org/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Community fridges: </b> You can find community fridges <a href='https://freedge.org/locations/' target='_blank'>here</a> and resources to start a community fridge <a href='https://freedge.org/freedge-yourself/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
                <li><b>Community gardens:</b> Although the is a time and initial cost investment, community gardens are a great way to grow your own fresh food, even when living in a city. Find your garden <a href='https://www.communitygarden.org/garden' target='_blank'>here.</a></li>
                <li><b>Libraries!</b> I am on a never-ending quest to show people how insanely helpful libraries are. Aside from lending books and media, your local library may host community events, training, and job assistance. <br><br>
                    Here are some just interesting types of resources libraries can provide:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Free wifi and computer access: This one may seem redundant but for those of us who do not have access to the internet at home, this is a major resource.</li>
                    <li>For those with access to internet, there are resources you can take advantage of from at home. Such as professional training at <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/learning/?u=74653650' target='_blank'>LinkedIn Learning</a>, free movies at <a href='https://www.zinio.com/'>Zinio.com</a>, and <a href='https://www.overdrive.com/' target='_blank'>Overdrive</a>, which has a variety of digital rental resources.</li>
                    <li>The culture pass program which lets you 'rent' out tickets to aquariums and museums for free.</li>
                    <li>Household tools for rent, even including sewing machines</li>
                    <li>Access to digital resources without a paywall, such as digital newspapers, online courses, and genealogy searches.</li>
                    <li>In person, libraries may host job fairs, GED preparation assistance, and allow you to lend exam preparation materials.</li>
                    <li>Wellness events such as yoga or nutrition classes. Some may even offer cooking classes as well.</li>
                    <li>The bottom line is that the best thing to do is to ask your local librarian! If you are unsure if something is offered, ask if they have something to help. Librarians are some of the sweetest people I've ever met, and they are happy to help.
</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Advocacy</h2>
                <p>Whether you need aid, want to donate your time, or help financially, here is a list of different advocacy groups that have resources and ways to help:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The <a href='https://www.aclu.org/' target='_blank'>American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a> has some amazing resources focused on American rights.</li>
                <li><a href='https://www.raceforward.org/' target='_blank'>Race forward</a>, focuses on racial justice and provides a great source of accessible information on race equality, activism efforts, and information on power structures that we live in. I definitely recommend signing up for <a href='https://colorlines.com/' target='_blank'>Colorlines</a>. </li>
                <li><a href='https://eji.org/get-involved/' target='_blank'>Equal Justice Initiative</a> focus on a variety of topics such as mass incarceration, racial justice, anti poverty, and public education.</li>
                <li><a href='https://www.npaf.org/' target='_blank'>National Patient Advocacy Foundation (NPAF)</a> has a variety of resources for patients and caregivers, advocating for health equity, and safety net services.</li>
                <li><a href='https://www.patientadvocate.org/' target='_blank'>Patient Advocacy Foundation</a> is similar to NPAF, but has resources in Spanish as well. They also have co-pay relief programs.</li>                
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Volunteer Programs</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href='https://www.bostoncares.org/' target='_blank'>Boston Cares</a> is a huge collection of service evens throughout the Boston area, constantly updating.</li>
                  <li><a href='https://www.servings.org/' target='_blank'>Community Servings</a> is similar in set up to Boston Cares where you sign up when you can. Here you pack meals that are delivered to people who are chronically and critically ill, providing healthy meals catered to their needs at their doorstep. Also, a great volunteer opportunity to do with friends! I often go with my sorority sisters.</li>
                  <li><a href='https://www.dana-farber.org/how-you-can-help/get-involved/volunteer/opportunities' target='_blank'>Dana Farber Cancer Institute</a> has a great program, I’ve learned so much from patients, clinicians, and other volunteers. There's a role for everyone, and the team there helps you feel supported throughout your volunteer journey. (Weekly commitment)</li>
                  <li><a href='https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/giving/ways-give-volunteer' target='_blank'>Tufts Medical Center</a> has another great program that provides a variety of opportunities. (Weekly commitment)</li>                  
                </ul>
              <h2>Boston Dance Teams</h2>
              <p>It wouldn't be my favorite resources if I didn't link how to find a variety of Boston's dance teams. Some of these teams are collegiate teams, but if you aren't a student don't worry! These teams may host events and workshops that are open to the public.</p>
